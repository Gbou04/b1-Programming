# B1 Programming Lab Exercises - Giovanni Aymen Bouzari 

This repository created by me contains all of my lab work for this programming course. Each folder comprises of my lab codes that correspond to the lecture covered.

Each lab goes in chronological order and focuses on crucial programming concepts that get incresingly more complex and builds up to the ability to implement fastPI to create a backend development.
